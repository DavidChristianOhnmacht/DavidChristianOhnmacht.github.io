I am a PhD student in the group of Professor Wolfgang Belzig at University of Konstanz in the south of Germany close to the swiss border. My research interests are superconducting junctions, in particular Multiterminal Josephson Junctions and transport junctions like Superconductor-superconductor (SS) junctions. These systems are very exciting for a theoretician like myself as they provide a beautiful playground for different aspects of condensed matter physics and mathematics. For example:

Multiterminal Josephson junctions...

... [host non-hermitian Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01289).  

... host unique transport processes involving multiple Cooper Pairs, so-called [Quartets](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.L241407).

Superconductor-superconductor junctions...

... naturally exhibit [Floquet physics](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.033176) upon an applied voltage.

... heavily break the [thermodynamic uncertainty relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01281) (TUR).

Research Highlights
======

Our manuscript [Non-hermitian topology in multiterminal superconducting junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01289) was recently accepted in Physical Review Letters. In this work, we show that Multiterminal Josephson Junctions coupled to normal metals host stable exceptional points. We find non-trivial non-hermitian topology by winding of two complex Andreev bound state bands around each other, leading to a point gap as seen below.
