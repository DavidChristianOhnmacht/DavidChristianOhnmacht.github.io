We study the interplay between Coulomb blockade and superconductivity in a tunable superconductor–superconductor–normal-metal single-electron transistor. The device is realized by connecting the superconducting island via an oxide barrier to the normal-metal lead and with a break junction to the superconducting lead. The latter enables Cooper pair transport and (multiple) Andreev reflection. We show that these processes are relevant also far above the superconducting gap and that signatures of Coulomb blockade may reoccur at high bias while they are absent for small bias in the strong-coupling regime. Our experimental findings agree with simulations using a rate equation approach in combination with the full counting statistics of multiple Andreev reflection.
